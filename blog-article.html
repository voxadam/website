            <p>I’m very excited to use this first post to talk about Dgraph, what it is and why it was created.</p>
            <p>Before I explain what’s Dgraph, let’s start with a basic understanding of graphs. A graph is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relationship between entities. A graph is thus composed of nodes connected by edges. Each node represents an entity (a person, place, thing, etc.), and each edge represents the relationship between two nodes. Some popular graphs that we all know about are the <a href="#">Facebook Social Graph</a>, and the Google Knowledge Graph.</p>
            <p>A graph database is a database that uses graph structures with nodes and edges to represent, store and serve data.</p>
            <h4>But who really uses graph databases?</h4>
            <p>More teams and companies than you’d think. Google, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, LinkedIn, Amazon, Dropbox, Pinterest — pick a company you are familiar with. If they’re doing something smart, chances are they’re probably using a graph database. Even very simple web apps have much to gain from graph databases. In the past, I’ve built a graph based REST framework, and using that cut down the code in half.</p>

            <p>This motivated me to start a project to standardize the data structures, and eventually serve them all using a single backend. Using the vast expertise of Metaweb team, we chose a data normalization structure that was also used by Knowledge Graph, the RDF Triples. By reconciling all the various entities from the different data feeds, we could start to reuse the data.</p>
            <p>But, there was a second and more challenging part to the problem. It was to build a system that could serve structured queries with data updating in real time. The system had to run behind Web Search, which meant that if it doesn’t respond within allocated milliseconds, Search would time out and move on. Also, this system had to tackle a major chunk of query load to Web Search, which amounts to thousands of queries per second.</p>

            <p>We basically had to build a low latency, high throughput system to serve graph queries.</p>
            <p>It was certainly an exciting project and held much promise. But, the harsh realities of the business environment and the attendant politics resulted in the cancellation of the project. Shortly thereafter I left Google in 2013 and didn’t give much thought to the project. Fast forward two years, I was hanging out on the Go language’s Slack channel and Stack Overflow. I saw quite a few people complaining about a popular graph database’s performance and stability.</p>
            <p>That’s when I realized that graph databases were starting to be used more frequently than it would appear from the surface. But a bit more digging around revealed a deeper problem:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Existing native graph databases weren’t designed to be performant or distributed.</li>
              <li>The ones that sharded the data and distributed it across a cluster</li>
              <li>They were largely serving as a graph layer over another database. </li>
              <li>This meant having many network calls should the intermediate number of results </li>
              <li> be large, which leads to performance degradation.</li>
              <li>For example, say you wanted to find.</li>
              <li>Assuming you have this data (hey Facebook!) and keeping things simple</li>
            </ol>
            <p>First you find all the people living in SF, and then secondly, intersect that list with all the people who eat Sushi.</p>
            <p>Do that for every query, and it would spike the <a href="#">95%-ile latency numbers</a> up dramatically, higher latency being worse.</p>
            <p>DGraph, on the other hand, is a native graph database in the sense that the data is handled directly by DGraph, and not given off to another database layer.</p>
            <p>This allows us to shard and relocate the data better, to minimize the number of network calls required per query. In fact, the above query would run in 2 network calls, irrespective of the cluster size.</p>
